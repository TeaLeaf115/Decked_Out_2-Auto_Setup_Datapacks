These are two datapacks that work in conjunction with Gnembon's `/player` command from the Carpet mod. This allows you to play TangoTek's Decked Out 2 without a second minecraft account to load the map.

Below is a descripion of the functionality of each datapack.

Link to download the correct version of Carpet Mod:
[Carpet Mod v1.4.122 for 1.20](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet/files/4573334)

## Datapacks:
**`doc.zip`:**
This is a pack you can ad directly into the `/datapacks/` folder inside your world file.
> **Commands: **
> `/funcion doc:run`
> 
> This will create a new player and run the commands used to set the player into spectator mode, teleporting them to the correct position and giving them a map to hold. 
---
**`hc_menu_v1.1.zip`:**
You will need to replace `hc_menu_v1.zip` with the `1.1` version so `doc:run` runs when you join the world this lets you join the game and immediatly jump right into the fun of Decked Out 2 without needing to remember to run the `doc:run` command.
